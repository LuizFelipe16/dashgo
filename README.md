Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
